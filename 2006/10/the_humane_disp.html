<hr /><h2>THE HUMANE DISPOSAL OF RODENTS</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>How can I catch these little fuckers?&nbsp; Tried the glue traps, tried the snap traps.&nbsp; Can't be bothered with steel wool.&nbsp; What is a <em>humane</em> way of disposing of them once I've caught them on those horrible glue traps?&nbsp; I hear the rats bite their legs off in order to get off the glue only to collapse face down onto the trap.&nbsp; Should I be smashing their tiny skulls with my hammer?&nbsp; Or simply throwing them alive (trap and all) into the waste bin?</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>a) rodents = inhumane, (but if they were white and fluffy you&#39;d be buying them in the paper, same as pigeons, which are the same as doves, only with a bad paintjob)<br />
b) they think not of your suffering when they leave tiny cocopops on your kitchen side or stuck to the bottom of your pepper pot, which flake out onto salad<br />
c) for every one you catch there are 10 more lurking</p>
<p>mr muscle oven cleaner is a good way of scorching them into infinity </p>

<p>You can get box style trap (no glue invoved). Only down side is you then have to take your new found friends for a little trip to a nearby wood/park/end of a tube line to release them. On the plus side I find that when using public transport facilities whilst fully laden with rats you tend to get a seat or two.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could fashion them into a rat king and pass it off as some sort of art installation. <br />
Good luck.</p>

<p>great suggestions.  Sir,  I can&#39;t get a cat cause my landlord won&#39;t allow it (he does allow a massive hole in my ceiling where rain runs through but that&#39;s a different post). Anon 1, I like your thinking but I still can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Anon 2, where can one acquire such devices?  A brand name would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I got mine from the &#39;trapman&#39; (website through msn) but you can probably get cheaper alternatives if you follow the other links.<br />
In all seriousness you need to think carefuly about what you&#39;re going to do once you&#39;ve caught it- picking up a cage full of rats may not be to everyones taste and access to a car would be good for relocation purposes.</p>
