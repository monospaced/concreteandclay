<hr /><h2>TAKING UP THE FIGHT</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>As I drove home, my friend sitting in the passenger seat, flicking through the local rag, I was mildly disappointed when she came up with a blank. However on deeper investigation (ie she opened her eyes properly!), there it was, slap bang in the middle pages: "Teacher attacks council over withdrawal (of support for Black History Month)". I had made it into the Fulham Chronicle. And to my even greater delight was labelled as "History teacher and race campaigner", a soubriquet that I shall certainly be taking up. The article describes how I "slammed" the (new Conservative) councils decision to withdraw support for Black History Month and how "disappointed" I was with this.This was alongside a comment that the decision to withdraw funding from schools to celebrate BHM  was "appalling", and pictured next to a delightful picture of myself (looking rather less than appalled and rather too pleased with myself, if I am being honest).  But all in all, a good day's work for the 'race campaigner'. Let's just hope they don't sack me.</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>I&#39;m not one for these thinly veiled attacks on campaigners like yourself. As a former striker (not like Shearer) and paid up union member, I fully understand how you may have felt. Keep up the media savey as a smile in the face of adversity goes a long way and gets more votes than an expletive.</p>
<p>You may even be laying the foundations for a future career in politics at this rate.</p>

<p>Do you think there is a need for white history month? wasn&#39;t everything you were taught at school &#39;white history&#39;? do you want to put yourself in the position of the exploited, oppressed and hidden?</p>
<p>H, I don&#39;t think I would go into organised politics - but do enjoy a bit of political knockabout.</p>

<p>easy sir.  Don&#39;t knock me about!  Only messin.  I think its a good thing what you&#39;re doin.  USA has had a black history month for as long as I can remember.  And no, everything I was taught at school didn&#39;t neccessarily involve white people.  </p>

<p>but where were you taught? if you are in the US it&#39;s ok to learn about African Americans, I would argue that we should be teaching Black British history in UK schools. Sorry if I came on a bit strong, I just get annoyed to hear the same shit over and over again. In fact the last time I posted stuff about it on a teacher forum some wag set up www.whitehistory4schools.com, ho ho ho.</p>
