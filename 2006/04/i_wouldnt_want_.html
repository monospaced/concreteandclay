<div class="blog-body"><blockquote><p>"I wouldn't want to be part of any club that would have me as a member" <cite>Groucho Marx</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I have never really got the Marx brothers, preferring Karl to either Groucho, Zippo or the others whose names I have no interest in recalling. However I thought about the quote above on Monday evening as I was turned away from <a href="http://www.trashclub.co.uk/">Trash</a> at <a href="http://www.endclub.com/">The End</a> because my friend and I had not made enough effort on the sartorial front. <acronym title="Concrete and Clay">C&amp;C</acronym> readers will be appalled to know that I was wearing my <a href="http://www.milkandbeef.com/">Milk and Beef</a> hoodie at the time. It led me to ponder on something that I have thought about for many years. Why do I feel like I want to be part of a movement, be it music/youth culture, political or social?</p><a id="more"></a><p>I remember as a 15 year old being identified as a "typical Smiths fan" and feeling absolutely great about that. I would have liked to be a mod or a punk. I felt a great affinity with the boys (and girls) on the North Bank at Highbury and genuinely felt a moment of intense elation seeing Anelka score at Wembley. I guess it's human nature to want to be part of the crowd, to have those shared experiences and I should be happy with my lot, but there's always going to be a part of me that wants more, to merge the individual into the collective. I think Karl might like that. </p></div>

<p>&quot;I have never really got the Marx brothers, preferring Karl to either Groucho, Zippo or the others whose names I have no interest in recalling.&quot;</p>
<p>I am shocked. I suggest you look at those brothers a little closer if you want to learn something. I believe you should give credit to anyone who can make someone ( in their case millions all over the world ) laugh in a time when hatred and racism smother the world. Besides, if you watched some of their shows you could pick up some tips about blagging your way in places...</p>

<p>Wanting to be part of the collective brings out the gestaltist in me.</p>

<p>Gestalt Theory and The Principle of Totality:</p>
<p>Any conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships.</p>
<p>It is argued that the same model can be applied to social systems.</p>
<p>Sorry.  I&#39;ll shut up now.</p>

<p>Does Gestalt essentially mean that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts? and that the desire to be part of that whole is the desire to be part of the process?</p>
