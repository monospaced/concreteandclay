<hr /><h2>ISLAND QUEENS</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>Here I am, 12,000 kms away from you lot of freakazoids. You gotta hang on tight down here or you might loose your grip and drop off the edge. The suicide rate is a bit of a worry down here in the depths of the south pacific. New Zealanders like to jump up and down a lot and say, look we can make big budget films and kick your lilly white asses at rugby. We have got some sort of paranoia about not getting noticed I guess. You would too if you were chained up down the backyard day and night, you would bark a lot too. Anyways, there is enough going on around these ways to keep me thoroughly in trouble. Some days I don't even bother poking me nose under the fence in case something occurs.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Take a gentle stroll up the road from my digs in central Auckland, a suburb called Kingsland, past the colourful weatherboard villas. Its not long before you hit the infamous Karangahape Road. Or, K Road to us locals. If your a south pacific islander and queer you will be right at home. Big motherfucker Samoans dressed in drag ready suck your cock hard. God knows who the clients are? Not me, honest. Fuck they must either be keen as or mad. One morning going about my business I noticed a hell of a scuffle in the car park. Three huge muscular Samoans, six foot plus, unshaven, wearing skimpy glitzy thigh hugging minis were attacking each other in the form of a vicious stone fight. They had feet like boats and were wearing stilettos. It was the dialogue that had me in stitches though, camp Samoan. Even hardcore no necker facists put down theer heads and quicken the pace when in this area. K Road is famous around here and has been since the early afro seventies. Over stayers from every south pacific nation have made Auckland their home over the past thirty five years. K Rd is worth a visit, the clubs, cafes and island street culture are ballistic and the people more than interesting. There is more to NZ than just sheep.</p>
<p>Auckland is a humid sub tropical city. South pacific islanders have made this place their universe over the past 40 years. In Samoa if a daughter is not produced the youngest son is raised as a girl, hence the outrageous number of cross dressers, trannies and mixed up genders or what ever you want to call this sub culture. There are more Samoans in Auckland than Samoa... But whatever, it all goes towards keeping our town unique.</p></div>
