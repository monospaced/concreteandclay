<hr /><h2>FILM FOR HUMANITY</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>I am dog tired. Sure I've worked hard before; teaching 30 disinterested, dysfunctional schoolboys ain't a piece of cake I can tell you, but today was something else. It's the school holidays so I thought I'd get myself a little project (6 weeks can get a bit boring, you know).</p>
<p>I was sent an email about a group of film makers who wanted to give something back to the community so they set up <a href="http://www.filmforhumanity.org.uk/">Film for Humanity</a> and invited 14 young film makers to come along and make some films to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cable_Street">Battle of Cable Street</a>.</p>
<p>Now family legend has it that my grandfather Sam was at Cable Street and took out a few fascists himself (Ok I may have embellished the last part, but hey, indulge me), so of course I was interested.</p><a id="more"></a><p>After a week of intensive studying about Cable Street, film making techniques, camera positions, script writing, actor calling, site locating, my partner (Ann-Eve, a Belgian journalist) and I were ready for some 'lights, camera, action'! Now I know why film crews have a gaffer - it would have been wonderful to have someone to lug the camera, sound equipment and tripod around the streets of the East End, but instead I had to do it myself. Still it was worth all the pain. </p>
<p>Our film is a spoof government propaganda film set in 2017, 10 years after the government passed an Immigration Act that stopped any more immigrants coming to Britain. As a result Britain has now had an economic collapse, the social fabric has decayed and even the football's boring. The new government has been elected on a promise of returning Britain to her status as the 'Mother Country' once more and this public information broadcast will help to restore the colour back to Britain.</p>
<p>You can see the final version, along with the six other films that are being made on Thursday 31 August at the <a href="http://www.genesis-cinema.co.uk/">Genesis Cinema</a>, Mile End Road, Whitechapel. Youcancallmesir also makes his film debut with a brief cameo. Enjoy. </p></div>
