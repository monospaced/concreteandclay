<p>I read this poem out in assembly this morning, along with &#39;In Flanders Fields&#39; and a list of names of former pupils and teachers that died in the First World War. It was powerful stuff. </p>
<p>I have also been in a very heated debate with my fellow history teacher who is vehemently opposed to the white poppies. Perhaps that is to be expected of a former para whose father was a Brigadier. I have conceded (for the moment) and am not wearing one, but I think that I will next week. </p>

<p>What is remembrance sir?<br />
Is it not just the decency one should have to be aware how powerful history is?</p>
<p>I wore my poppy with pride today. Fall out still falls on the innocent post appocalyptic souls</p>

<p>If the red poppy represents bloodshed from lives lost, why is it that the white poppy represents peace. Why wear a badge for peace. Peace should be taught, not worn on our lapels but radiate from our souls. Peace is as natural as breathing.<br />

<p>i hardly think being used as cannon fodder and left to die at eighteen years old by a country that doesn&#39;t give a shit about you because you are working class and not an officer is the ultimate sacrifice. the ultimate betrayal more like.</p>

<p>ah nancy.  question not the politics involved as these boys didn&#39;t get that chance and with so many young people still fighting overseas, its damaging to their morale to shout from rooftops that the war is a sham.  do you really believe they died in vain?  especially those who fought between 39-45?</p>

<p>You absolutely should question the politics. If there was one legacy of WW1 is was that our &#39;glorious leaders&#39; - or rather &#39;Lions led by Donkeys&#39; - should be always held accountable for the nation going to war. That is why there is so much opposition to the war in Iraq, where we were clearly deceived by Bush and Blair. Every death in war is a death in vain.  </p>

<a id="c25518784"></a>
<p>that&#39;s a fair point but just remember the army has no say in the matter.  they simply execute orders.  as such, they are not responsible for the politics.  not supporting them now, whilst they fight on behalf of their nation is lamentable in my book.</p>
<p>had no soldier sacrificed their life in WW2, the nazis would have thrived and there probably wouldn&#39;t be any Jews in Europe anymore.  certainly those soldiers did not die in vain.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know anyone&#39;s opinion on Haig. Was he the vilain or the saviour?</p>
<p>If we had stood by and let the Kaiser roll over Europe would concrete and clay exist now or would I be writing by candle light in my concrete blokhaus covered in clay as the Red Chinese launch a counter attack on rocket propelled mopeds? Europe would not be Europe and all our ancestors would have joined the Resistance.</p>
<p>Would the Holocaust have taken place?</p>
