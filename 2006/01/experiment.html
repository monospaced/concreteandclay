<div class="blog-body"><p>I have been on a website and been led to believe that if I let people know about their website, I will get a new camera.</p><a id="more"></a><p>My current camera is big and heavy and I have been wanting to get a new one for time, if you or anyone you know click on this link and sign up to some other thing (I bought the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and some other <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym>, for £10) I will receive this camera. Am I being done? Will my identity be stolen? Will I receive nothing but a life lesson? I am tired of living in fear, I don't want to believe that everyone is out to get me. Anyway, click the link then register whatever name you choose, and you too can join this crazy internet experiment. Or at least check this site for a comical account of my misfortunes.</p>

<p>Thanks, as a precaution I always give my birth date a year out and a seperate billing adress to my registered home adress. I believe due to my squintiness I didn&#39;t fill the fields in correctly anyway. The experiment continues... </p>

<p>Ok,  it was no-where NEAR as good as Gene Wilder&#39;s interpretation of the troubled chocolatier, but it still rocked. </p>
