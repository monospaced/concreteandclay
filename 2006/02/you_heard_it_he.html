<div class="blog-body"><p>Rumours are sweeping the football world that the Arsenal defender Sol Campbell is about to be "outed" by a Sunday newspaper, hence his mysterious disappearance on wednesday evening (and with Tottenham's Jermaine Jenas, ooh there must be a lot of footie tension in that household). I can't understand how we have got ourselves into a situation where our media is so powerful that it has the power to destroy people's lives, seemingly at will. The rumours about Sol have been around for years - his brother served a prison sentence as a result of a fight he got in to disprove the allegation - so why have the newspapers chosen now to go public? And more importantly why do we care?</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>Poor fella.  Read about this in aforementioned papers with same curiosity as everyone else I guess.  I always liked Sol.  I never thought he might be gay though.  And who cares anyway?  If he needs to shoot some hoops to be happy (and effective) on the pitch, then let him get his dose.</p>
<p>I AGREE (yes that&#39;s right) with Sir this time.  Its no good prying into these peoples lives, even if they do make £100K a week.</p>

<p>no offense but you cared enough to sensationalise it on here so that says something</p>

<p>Yeah.  You re right. Fuck em.  If they make that much money, they should assume the negative consequences, no matter their sexual orientation.</p>

<p>An intelligent black man, who plays professional football, and  isn&#39;t seen regularly falling out of China White&#39;s with a bimbo on his arm. Oh, he is soooo gay.</p>

<p>no offence taken, you make a valid point. I guess I was trying to focus on the role of the media, rather than the gossip. It just seems like there has been a significant amount of tabloid activity in the last few months, which has led to people being exposed in a way that I consider unsavoury, to say the least. And I don&#39;t agree that just because you might be rich or in the public eye that you necessarily have to be dragged through the gutter being publically flayed.   </p>

<p>CAMPbell can run away to Belgium when the heat is on privately, but his private life has interfered with his professional one and so in this case, I&#39;m sure Arsenal fans have a right to know why their overpaid defender underperformed in the last match before his dissapearance.</p>

<p>Here’s another slant on the Campbell story, apparently he’s been diagnosed HIV Positive. That would explain his deteriorating physical fitness and poor performances in recent months.<br />

<p>Interesting story Rob, I haven&#39;t heard that one before - are you sure that&#39;s not been put out by the boys from White Hart Lane to get back at their Judas?</p>
