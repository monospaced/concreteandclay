<hr /><h2>YOUCANCALLMESIR LIVE ON ITV</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>For those of you who have been following the stratospheric media career of C&Cs very own 'youcancallemesir', the long awaited appearance on prime time television nears. 'sir' will be on ITV's 'Fortune: Million pound giveaway' on Tuesday January 23rd between 8 and 9 pm, where (hopefully if the editor has any humour at all) you may actually hear the immortal phrase 'you can call me sir' being uttered. The premise of the programme is that 5 millionaires, Jeffrey Archer, Duncan Bannantyne, Jacqueline Gold, Kanye King and Simon Jordan have each put Â£200k into a pot which will be distributed to worthy recipients. Each contestant has 60 seconds to make their pitch and then face questions from the panel. 'sir' was bidding to take 40 pupils from his school to the First World War battlefields in France and Belgium, but now wishes he had asked for a tummy tuck or an all expenses trip of a lifetime to Vegas. Will he win, you'll have to watch to find out!</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>Yes Sir.</p>
<p>It may only be TV but those two biggots would not have been able to make it through the barbed wire to storm those trenches. I bet   they would have got the clap before they even made the front by shagging some whore in Amiens and thier dicks would have fallen off.</p>
<p>As you know, it is a moving experience and one those kids will remember. I turned the box off when I saw that prog comi ng on and then got onto C and Clay only to see your post.</p>

<p>Many thanks - youcancallmemonsieur - it seems I may have started a trend. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience despite having to prostitute myself to Archer et al. I have managed to record it on DVD so will do my best to youtube it asap.</p>
