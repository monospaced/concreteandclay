<div class="blog-body"><p>Having been approached last week to appear in a national women's magazine to spout my opinions and perspectives on various worldly matters, as well as to get obnoxiously drunk and receive new clothes for free, and thereafter having considered the beaming pride it might engender in my family's collective bosum, I found myself in an oddly coloured, big-brotheresque coloured room in the middle of an imposing skyscraper in central london yesterday afternoon.
</p>
<p>As I took a mushroom-shaped seat opposite a slightly withered someoneorother who Id seen in the dating columns of both the london paper and london lite, a smattering of australians and a couple of women eating grapes and covered in orange makeup, I heard questions such as &quot;If you had a superpower, what would it be?&quot; asked by the magazine people and being met with enthusiastic responses by the assembled group. </p>
<p>With the horror of what I'd let myself in for seeping through me like piss in a nocturnal bed, I heard my name called for makeup and on autopilot asked where the toilet was. As I left the room, an orange-faced someone was explaining when they had enjoyed their last snog in response to another magazine person. In 30 seconds I was back out onto the street, sweating slightly like a bearded Harrison Ford. </p>
<p>As I cycled home, truant-like in relief and freedom, ignoring the calls of the magazine people wondering if I'd fallen down the toilet, I realised that although I'm cheap, I'm not quite Asda. Yet. And fame is for losers.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>For all you Peer2Peer fans out there (and for those of you who haven't a clue what that means, it is another phrase for file sharing) it is well worth checking out the new extension from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://www.allpeers.com/">allpeers</a>. It's a really excellent piece of software that allows large files to be shared easily. Maybe we should set up a C&C network. You can 'contact' me through the allpeers network as danlyndon.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>Add your own verse to this one and we'll compile a lyrics medley.</p>
<p>It'll be the gravy or the jus to accompany those bijou beats that C and C has flooed the airwaves with. (cerise sur le gateau)</p>
<p>Run it...</p>
<p>You've got to do or die, as pressure mounts to comply</p>
<p>Ask searching questions-how did Icarus fly?</p>
<p>Replys come forthwith, make concessions and take and give</p>
<p>Give and take and remake an adaptation, base it solely on creation</p>
<p>When doing is done, have fun, go forth travel never shun</p>
<p>What's done is done-bullet point number one-Do or die concerns everyone.</p>
<p>Hence, given the chance to score my &quot;X&quot; my pen will press,</p>
<p>Elected in situation, nothingness stagnates and creates elation,</p>
<p>Proceeding head nods are of approbation, got me asboed and on probation</p>
<p>Do or die resolves the healing of the nation.</p>
<p>The Earl of Lyricshire.</p>

<div class="blog-body"><p>For those of you who have been following the stratospheric media career of C&Cs very own 'youcancallemesir', the long awaited appearance on prime time television nears. 'sir' will be on ITV's 'Fortune: Million pound giveaway' on Tuesday January 23rd between 8 and 9 pm, where (hopefully if the editor has any humour at all) you may actually hear the immortal phrase 'you can call me sir' being uttered. The premise of the programme is that 5 millionaires, Jeffrey Archer, Duncan Bannantyne, Jacqueline Gold, Kanye King and Simon Jordan have each put Â£200k into a pot which will be distributed to worthy recipients. Each contestant has 60 seconds to make their pitch and then face questions from the panel. 'sir' was bidding to take 40 pupils from his school to the First World War battlefields in France and Belgium, but now wishes he had asked for a tummy tuck or an all expenses trip of a lifetime to Vegas. Will he win, you'll have to watch to find out!</p></div>
