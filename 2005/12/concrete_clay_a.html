<p>From virtual to reality back to virtual reality in one night is an impressive state of mind. Bring on the 1st birthday party!</p>

<p>If you need to change the title of my post to make it more accurate, its ok.  But I would never write XMas as I am Roman Catholic.  I would never deny my saviour.  Christmas is the day Christ was born.  &quot;Xmas&quot; is for unfaithful profiteers.</p>

<p>Post title will be changed to prioritise religous sensitivites over shorter line length!</p>

<p>However, as a historian I would like to point out that Xmas is perfectly acceptable as it originates from the Greek X which stands for Christ. As someone who now knows &#39;the Master&#39;, I would take that posting with a rather heavy dose of irony. Or Ken do you still want to discuss &#39;immaculate conception&#39; in a rational state of mind?</p>

<p>Uhhh...  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  That&#39;s it exactly.  Merry Christmas.  In America, they change it so as to not offend other faiths,  thats just too politically correct for me. </p>

<p>Youcancallmesir,</p>
<p>That&#39;s where faith comes in.  I don&#39;t need proof.  Just my faith in Him.</p>

<a id="c12191793"></a>
<p>I&#39;m sorry Ken but faith is bollox. Where is your rational thought here? how can a highly intelligent psychology grad come up with that lame argument - you&#39;ll be telling me that Santa exists next!</p>
<p>I would like to quote one of my heroes, Richard Dawkins:</p>
<p>Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence. </p>
<p class="posted">Posted by: <span class="author">youcancallmesir</span> |  2:57pm&nbsp;&nbsp;19 December 2005</p><hr />
<a id="c12192611"></a>
<p>True faith is an existential choice.</p>
<p>Faced with the unknowable mystery of the universe, we can choose to believe, or not to believe. There will never be a proof to validate either choice, we must choose in absolute darkness. This is Kierkergard&#39;s &quot;leap of faith&quot;.</p>
<p>Religious people in the modern world don&#39;t usually take this terrifying leap into the unknowable world of faith; modern religion and religious practises are more about cultural identity, family, tradition and politics IMO.</p>
<p>Intelligent Design advocates (like those in Dawkin&#39;s UK TV show last night) make the fatal mistake of thinking that their faith brings certainty. In fact, it is absolute uncertainty that is the bedrock of truth faith.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a song by New Order, of course.</p>

<p>&quot;Religious people in the modern world don&#39;t usually take this terrifying leap into the unknowable world of faith;&quot;</p>
<p>Granted, although the Master seems to.</p>
<p>&quot;modern religion and religious practises are more about cultural identity, family, tradition and politics&quot; </p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head with the idea of tradition. I guess as someone who defines themselves on the left I find it hard to accept the conservatism of religion. Equally as someone who has rejected the religious upbringing that I had, I am less inclined to accept the part of the family that is associated with religion. If someone asked me about my belief, i would vociferously argue that I am an atheist (of Jewish birth) and I strongly tow the marxist line about religion being the &#39;opium of the masses&#39;. </p>
<p>I prefer Love Vigilantes myself</p>

<a id="c12279063"></a>
<p>Youcancallmesir,</p>
<p>Not everything is rational and logical Faith does not neccessarily bring certainty but you have to explore it on a level where its not about you or your Bertrand Russelesque nneed for control of  your environment.  Faith is bollox because to YOU only because  can&#39;t allow yourself to try and believe..  People have faith in many things, not just neccessarily religious  stuff.</p>
<p>BTW, apologies for the typos, I&#39;m writing on a broken kescreeenn</p>

<p>There ain&#39;t nothing wrong with control freakery, that&#39;s how things get done! When I was a young man I tried to believe, cos that was what I was socialised to do, but you know, in the end I couldn&#39;t be bothered any longer. What&#39;s the point of trying to believe in anycase? I can try to believe that Arsenal will win the Premiership this season but it&#39;s not going to happen. Still there&#39;s always &#39;wishful thinking&#39; which is what you can have if you want. And you haven&#39;t said which New Order track you prefer.  </p>
