<p>Junko send me e-mail that she likes Guitar most. She told me &quot;Sea Turtle Wireless&quot; will be out soon, but only song &quot;By the Beach #2&quot; came out now... I love to hear her talk with it. It is more interesting to listen!!  </p>

<p>Sea Turtle Wireless will be released next week on Concrete &amp; Clay.  Yes the picture is of the Hudson because my archives are limited.  If anyone has a better picture, send it in to the editor at www.info@concreteandclay.org.  The winning picture will get a free exclusive, unreleased, MP3.</p>
<p>Best of Luck.  (I&#39;ll be down at Water Taxi Beach with my quicksnap).<br />

<p>Oh, cool isn&#39;t it. I love Junko&#39;s &quot;Sea Turtle Wireless&quot; with &quot;By The Beach #2&quot; <br />
Concreteandclay likes to change titles, so they copnfuse Junko&#39; Fans and Supporters. Junko told ME that she did not put &quot;By the Beach #2&quot; to &quot;By the Beach&quot; because she recorded her original &quot;By the Beach&quot; for fun with her friends while she was at school. It was karaoke of WH&#39;s song called &quot;Tell Me No&quot;, but she likes to call this for &quot;By The Beach&quot; I listed it, and it was fun because it was different words on the music. <br />
Well, This &quot;By The Beach&quot; at concreteandclay now on 9/6/05 is supposed to be posted &quot;By The Beach #2&quot; everyone!!   </p>

<p>It was brought to my attention that this song its actually called &quot;By the Beach # 2&quot;.  Not to be confused with &quot;By the Beach&quot; which was an illegal WH bootleg.  However, in light of the fact that &quot;By the Beach&quot; will never be released (legally), on this website, or any other, &quot;By the Beach #2&quot; will retain its current title &quot;By the Beach&quot;.  The post title will change as this is relatively easy to do. Sorry for any inconvenience but die-hard Junko fans will know what the score really is. </p>

<p>“By the Beach #2” is good: the vocal melody is pretty, very melancholy. Junko sounds like she is ready to cry the whole song, just remembering what happened by the beach. It completely reminds me of a song I’ve heard before, but I can’t place my finger on what song. If I can remember I’ll let Junko know.  </p>
