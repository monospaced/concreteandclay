<div class="blog-body"><p>Unusual. The walk along the heath was the same as he had done pretty much every day for the last twelve years, shuffling along, occasionally humming the tune that had been in his head since he woke up that morning. This time, as he approached the fork in the path he decided that instead of turning up towards the hill he would instead go the longer way round and head across towards the pond.</p>
<p>Dead. In Norse mythology there were certain punishments reserved for the most heinous crimes. The "spread eagle" involved the recipient having the front of their chest split down the centre of the rib cage with one cleave of an axe and the "arms" of the ribs ripped open exposing the organs and forming a shape resembling the wing of an eagle.</p>
<p>Sick. There are certain moments when you just wish that the earth&nbsp; will open up and swallow you whole, just like the time that I mentioned how crap that woman's presentation was and, of course, surprise, surprise she was standing right behind me. Swift exit, stage right. &quot;Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers&quot; swinging between my eardrums, it was going to be a hot one today, scorchio. And nothing prepares you for a sight like that. I just wish I had left my axe at home this morning.</p><a id="more"></a></div>
