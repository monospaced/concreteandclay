<div class="blog-body"><p>There's a sauna on the Old Kent Road called Sauna 666 (passed it on a bus). There's an arcade on Peckham Rye called Jive Leisure that if you look at in reverse says 'Evil Leisure'. Inside the window of this arcade is a porcelain model of a shepherd sleeping whilst his flock wander off.</p>
<p>There's a 90% chance that the zip on your coat/jeans etc says YKK on it.</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>I once bought a hot chocolate after swimming at the local pool and discovered the word &quot;cunt&quot; embossed on the biege plastic cup. As I drank the water-uht solution I pondered whether this was a message solely for me. I was amazed when the cocoa powder silt stuck to the bottom of the cup to reveal the shape of a penis.</p>

<p>As a youth I had the occasional Marlboro and it was a widely known urban myth that there were various KKK (ku klux klan) signs dotted around the packet. <br />
What or who is YKK?</p>

<p>The founder member of that well known zipper organisation had not only a pension for all in one white garments (which was what necessitated the zips in the first place) but also liked a little tipple.<br />
