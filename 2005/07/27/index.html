<div class="blog-body"><p>Dear All,</p>
<p>My first post, so a short introduction: I'm setting up a sonic journal. </p>
<p>The idea: Record an event in the day and create an online archive.</p>
<p>The idea continued:  The recorded material will be used as an initial sound palette for creating further sonic works in the field of 'found sounds' and will be published either as a CD or online. </p>
<p>Some points: Anyone interested can participate. Recorded material must be of an event (however mundane) and must be of one's own. </p>
<p>First entry today at <a href="http://tisanesound.free.fr/index%20journal.html">tisanesound</a>.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted of new entries. You may contact me at: &#00116;&#105;s&#97;&#00110;&#00101;s&#00111;&#00117;n&#100;&#00064;&#0102;&#114;&#0101;&#00101;&#46;f&#114;</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>From the vantage point of my place of work, I was last week able to observe the nearly-exploded Hammersmith and City Line train and the railway track and street along which the suspected jihadist fled. Throughout the day my friends and I gazed towards the train, half expecting a combustion of some sorts, which thankfully never happened. </p>
<p>However, on the next day, something more out of the ordinary than an explosion occured. As we gazed through an telescope at the section of road that the terrorist allegedly ran down, which had by this time been cordoned off by police tape, we observed various police officers and sniffer dogs tracing slowly along the road looking for clues. All was humdrum. Then, suddenly, from the periphery of the scope, we caught a glimpse of the most extraodinary figure it has been my (mis)fortune to view, a sight which indelibly scorched itself onto my consciousness. </p>

<div class="blog-body"><p>So it was hot and humid again and the last thing I wanted to do was set foot outside, away from my A.C. unit. But my Mexicali friend called me and invited me out. Normally, and especially under the circumstances, I would have made up an excuse not to go out. However, having not seen him in a while, I reluctantly accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;My friend is playing a new form of synthesizer in Dumbo, Brooklyn&quot;, he told me. &quot;He is playing in an art gallery during a showing of his friend's paintings of audio cables&quot;.</p>
<p>I must say it all sounded very intriguing. So off we went in search of this tiny art gallery underneath the Brooklyn bridge.</p>
<p>The artist in question was Eric LoPresti and the music was provided courtesy of Tim &quot;Love&quot; Lee and his brand spankin' new <a href="http://www.macbethstudiosystems.com/">Macbeth Studio Systems M5</a>. The paintings were absolutely surreal as was the music which accompanied them.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting evening to say the least.</p>
<p>Check out the following link for more details and images of Eric's paintings:</p>
