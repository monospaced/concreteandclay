<div class="blog-body"><p><img alt=" " src="../../images/haile_selassie.jpg" /></p>
<p>It had been 10 years since I'd seen Hiroy.</p>
<p>At the time, we both lived in Antibes but none of us were from there. He helped me with my calculus and trig'.</p>
<p>We arrived in Philly at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. We had to rent a car after the fuel pump gave way on the truck. So we got a convertible, filled 'er up, and got on the freeway, top down, with Junior Gong playing so loud the speakers were crackling.</p>
<p>We got to Philly's East African neighbourhood and settled in at this one joint called <a href="http://www.ucnet.com/gojjo/">Gojjo</a>. The waitress was Irish Italian (I lost $5 bucks on a bet, I thought she was Norse) but everyone else was pretty much from the oldest continent. A picture of His Majesty hung above the spirits.</p>
<p>Hiroy and I weren't the best of friends back then, but seeing him again after ten years means a lot. The funny thing is: It felt as though we were back in the past, or that those ten years had elapsed in ten hours. Reality kicks in when you see how much someone has aged and realise that you must have aged considerably too.</p><a id="more"></a></div>

<p>Hey dan,  the &quot;geezer&quot; in the picture was the last Emperor on Earth to be directly descended from King Solomon.  Its really more a faith issue than a race one.  </p>

<p>Hey man, the &quot;W&quot; word has been taken back by the whites, it is no longer a matter of colour, race, creed, greed merely a state of mind. We use the&quot;W&quot; word when &#39;frontin&#39; our peers. Seen,</p>
