<div class="blog-body"><p>Every time I walk to Liverpool Street station, the endless procession of pigeons, blackboards, pink scooters, suits, sodden flyers, bagel wrappers and faded stencillry is broken into pieces by a huge white spire that towers over Spitalfields market. As soon as you get round the corner of the Truman Brewery building you see it there looming all awful and grand, like a temple of doom, or a lost ark, no matter where you look all the way to Liverpool Street. You can’t hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of milk. There’s something about the way this huge pile of ancient looking marble towers precariously over everything.</p>
<p>Not that much is known about <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000054.shtml">Nicholas Hawksmoor</a>, the man who designed it way back in 1714, except that he was a mason who might have had some issues, as he allegedly built the church on some pagan point of significance, above a huge roman burial ground, and in alignment with the other churches he was commissioned to build in London. If you mark the five other churches he built on a map of London they form the &quot;Eye of Horus&quot;, an ancient Egyptian symbol of power and death also known as the &quot;All Seeing Eye&quot;, which now takes pride of place on all dollar bills.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>I’m not one for travelling. So when I was offered a job in Williamsburg, I thought &quot;shit, that's pretty far&quot;. I don't like riding the MTA and try to avoid it as much as possible. The L has no express that I know of and travelling to Brooklyn over the summer's gonna melt my m&amp;m's.</p>
<p>When temperatures are recorded by meteorologists, they always measure in the shade...<br />
... why stay in the shade then?</p>
<p>BTW, the L will be the first fully automated train on the MTA. Graff will write itself and the homeless will now be accepting all major credit cards.</p>
<p>Why not put some A.C. units in the trains and automate those using, say, a barometer?</p>
<p>Just a thought...</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/netmusic/page/0,13368,1127237,00.html">Legal music downloads</a> are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/netmusic/story/0,13368,1385687,00.html">big news</a> in 2005. Five years ago it was <em>illegal</em> downloads that were making the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/852283.stm">headlines</a>. But after that, file sharing just got <a href="http://www.afternapster.com/">even bigger</a>. So what happened?</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>I work to live, how about you? You could always <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/19/133129/548">quit to be a bike courier</a>. Not me, I actually like sitting in a cubicle for thirty five hours a week. It's really not as bad as it sounds. Fuzzy blue partitions protect me from prying eyes of colleagues (overgrown schoolboys in suits), and basking in work-shy corporate culture, I'm mostly free to use a computer for whatever I see fit (as long as I can hack round the firewall, which I can). So I helped build this website. Now I'm writing on it. Sure, I could've played Solitaire, but I think I'd rather be a bike courier.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>It is official, spring is here, the cherry blossom is on the trees, the sun is shining and all is good. I heard a lawn mower this morning, I walked in a sun ray and felt fine even though my pockets were empty. Save money in the spring by walking places instead of paying for transport (a walk can be fun), hide beers and <span lang="de">taschen flaschen</span> under jumpers and enjoy al fresco hospitality of local drinking establishments. Switch off your heating and make the most of your winter clothes until you put them away till October. Forget B.B.Q's and expensive polluting charcoal briquettes, a sandwich toaster and an extension lead has been the basis of many excellent get-togethers. This Saturday in London is a large <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/">anti war demonstration</a>, a perfect example of a free fun day out. I'll see you there.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>Emily and Julie's Extraordinary Jumble sale has quickly received the underground shoppers paradise status it deserves.
