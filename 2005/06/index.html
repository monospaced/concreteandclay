<div class="blog-body"><p><img height="293" src="../../images/carol.jpg" width="400" alt=" " /></p>
<p>I have been drinking solidly since I heard of Richard's death. Although we never actually met I feel like a piece of my life has disappeared forever. We would meet in the afternoon, he looked so radiant whether in black and white or Ferguson colour. I have never liked Carol and I think she looks cheap. I hope they axe Countdown as a sign of respect.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>The other night I went to Noodle King, ordered some food, ate it, and walked off. I did not pay for it. I did not avoid payment on purpose but I have financially benefitted from my forgetfullness. If I had done it deliberately, I wonder if I would have been chased and asked to pay for my 49b and mixed fruit juice?</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>It's taken me twelve years, and a conversation down the pub last night, to realise that its all about the process. It doesn't matter what you do, in my case transmitting knowledge of sorts (you can pick and choose what you fancy) is about how you bring someone along with you. It's not the journey that matters, its how you get there and what you bring with you along the way. My journey took a steep turn for the better this week, but I know that it's the start of a whole new adventure. I am prepared.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>Blessed be the Lord everyday.<br />
But just that little bit extra today.</p>
<p>Am I crazy or am I the only one who gets childhood flashbacks?  I'm not talking about when you catch a whiff of perume or scent that takes you back,  I'm talking about actual flashes from the past.  They usually occur for me during the changing of the seasons.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you feel it too.  Its such a wonderful experience, verging on cathartic.</p>
<p>On that note,  I'd like to hear some flashes you may have experienced recently.  No need to give details of the actual flash, just the sensation it evoked in you.</p>
<p>Lets share these feelings.</p></div>

<div class="blog-body"><p>London is a car that's been parked in the sun all day long and I am a dog with my tongue sticking through a crack in the window. </p>
<p>Today at lunch I saw a willow look-alike throwing the day's papers into a bin. An enraged shopkeeper ran onto the street cursing him. </p>
<p>'News! News! News!' the willow figure called, throwing the Mail back where it belongs. A Sun simmered on top of the bin next to a banana. </p></div>
