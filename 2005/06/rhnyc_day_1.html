<hr /><h2>RHNYC DAY 1</h2>
<div class="blog-body"><p>Yeah so. </p>
<p>I went yesterday but today I'm staying home with my Margaritas (Herbie, I don't drink white wine unless that's all there is).</p>
<p>I went to a conference featuring the editor of Remix Magazine, Jeru, Jae Millz, Needlz, Cipha Sounds (A&amp;R for Rawkus and now producer in his own right) and this other cat Jay-Jay representing Defected (house music).</p>
<p>JERU WAS SO GENUINE but apparently cashless.</p>
<p>The other guys were so into the paper it was unimpressive (but rich apparently, Needlz got publishing on The Game's album).</p>
<p>On the technology side, I attended the Digidesign Pro Tools conference and picked up some tabs from them kids.</p>
<p>Very impressive was Akai's new MPD-16 which is a USB/MIDI Pad control surface (think of the MPC pads without all the other bollocks that just plugs straight into your computer). Another display was Stanton's Final Scratch 2 AMP which resolves Final Scratch 1's latency issues and allows for 24bit recording. Akai's new MPC is quite impressive too. It gives the user the feel of the original MPC but with USB compatibility (the MPC1000 was USB but was limited in its MIDI and Interface capabilities). Serato's &quot;Scratch Live&quot; seemed hot cause they were the only scratch product that used a scratch DJ for their demo, DJ Babu.</p>
<p>I'm too wasted to go today but I will go tommorrow. The panel will include Jimi Kendrix (Jay-Z, Ja Rule), Mathematics &amp; U-God (Wu-Tang), Grandmaster Caz &amp; Tony Tone (Cold Crush Brothers), and others, but me be lazy to list 'em all.</p>
<p>Me also keep you up 2 date on developments. </p>

<p>I saw those MPC pads that plug into the computer through USB on AKAI&#39;s site they look pretty dope, however my only concern is not having that old 8-16 bit sound, that thump you get from the MPC or any old equipment - the price I remember was about Â£250 queens heads. </p>
<p>Speaking of that boom bap thump... KRS-1 - Shepards Bush on Wed 8th of June was the best show I have seen for a long time-respect due to the Blastmaster. </p>
<p>its a shame JERU is cashless - mayb since he split from working around primo and others - politics and bullsh*t...My &quot;Come Clean&quot; 12&quot; is still kept in mint condition just because it is one the best tracks in his hey day...Its a damn shame that he is feeling the lint in his pocket - talent that shouldn&#39;t go to waste</p>
<p>If you can please drop any more up and coming events - technology wise or music wise - that are happening - because me and a few others would be very interested. And if you know any gigs that are happening in London, give some shout outs, I heard Diamond D is playing out soon in Camden...</p>
<p>P.S. I know that this is an international meeting place for peeps, therefore I am taking pot luck that you are in the U.K.</p>
<p>Peace out</p>

<p>Well my only criticism of those MPD pads is that they don&#39;t have the note repeat function which allows you to trigger quantised notes in rapid succession.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t feel bad about Jeru, when I said he was cashless, it was in relation to the other younger cats.  I&#39;m sure Jeru is doing fine with his royalties.</p>
<p>And no, I&#39;m not in the UK.</p>

<p>Oh and as for that &quot;punchy&quot; sound, you might want to get a nice Analog/Digital convertor like the Apogee Rosetta 800.  This will make all your productions &quot;pop out&quot; like old analog tape.</p>

<p>pHiLLy,</p>
<p>recording onto tape will give your mix warmth yeah.  but a good convertor will preserve the depth when you send it back to your computer.</p>
<p>If you have the resources to go straight to tape than that&#39;s the shit right there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the last company to make tape, Quantegy, went bust six months ago.  A new company has taken the reigns but its slow in coming.</p>
<p>have a read!</p>

<p>good luck</p>
