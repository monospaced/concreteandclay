<p>Testify!</p>
<p>Before Reakes home study I was a nobody.<br />
By day, I would while away the hours in my &#39;personal&#39; two foot sqare compartment in a shared office;sharing occasional chats and coffees with collegues.By night I&#39;d lie awake slicing and dicing in a futile attempt to extract some form of emotion. </p>
<p>The postcards, executive toys, primula I used to exert my personality just were&#39;nt enough. It was time to change- but how?</p>
<p>Rejecting the immediate thrill that a jump sans bungee from the my office block may have provided, I decided to seek help from Reakes home study programme.</p>
<p>Within minutes of opening the first of a series of stained envelopes to fall into my executive cubicle, my life was transformed.</p>
<p>Soon my previously erratic income rocketted to the dizzy heights of over £56 per week, no effort required! People now continiously try to contact me and are endearingly persistant in the eager attempts to arrange appointments .Now I am a Somebody - I even have a book to prove it.  </p>
<p>Reakes Home Study programme saved my life.</p>
<p>Thankyou Reakes.<br />
